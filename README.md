# betgames-testing

Created an automatized testing script for betgames. There will be a prompt from which you can select 3 possible tests for the sector as well as select the browser that you want the test to run on.

Will need to install termcolor, selenium, webdriver_manager.

To run simply main.py in the directory through a terminal.
